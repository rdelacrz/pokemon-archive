This React-based application uses the [Vite framework](https://vitejs.dev) to run the development server and and build the production bundle. It also makes use of [vite-plugin-ssr](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com) to provide additional features such as Server Side Rendering, Filesystem Routing, and Vercel deployment capabilities.
